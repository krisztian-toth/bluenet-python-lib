# Bluenet BLE

### This only works on linux due to the usage of BlueZ.


Since the Crownstone communicates through BLE, we can use BLE to tell it to do things!

This library works with Python 3.5 and higher. It does not work with Python 3.4...

# Requirements

We need libbluetooth-dev for developing with BLE.

```
sudo apt-get install build-essential libbluetooth-dev libglib2.0-dev python3-setuptools
```

# Installing Bluenet BLE

You can use the setupBLE.py to install Bluenet + BluenetBLE. If you are on other platforms than Linux, you can use setup.py to install just Bluenet.

```
sudo python3 setupBLE.py install
```


# Running Example

All scripts containing BLE should be run as sudo because scanning using BlueZ requires root rights.

```
sudo python3 ./examples/examplesBle/example_continuous_scanning.py
```

# Documentation

To use Bluenet BLE, you first import it from Bluenetlib.

```python
from BluenetLib.BLE import BluenetBle

myBluenetBle = BluenetBle(hciIndex=0)
```

BluenetBle is composed of a number of top level methods and modules for specific commands. We will first describe these top level methods.


##### `__init__(hciIndex=0)`
> When initializing the BluenetBle class, you can provide an hciIndex. On linux, 0 means /dev/hci0, 1 /dev/hci1 etc. Usually 0 is the right one. You can check which one you need with:
> ```
> hciconfig
> ```
> The constructor is not explicitly called with __init__, but like this:
>```python
>myBluenetBle = BluenetBle(hciIndex=0)
>```


##### `isCrownstoneInSetupMode(address: string, scanDuration=3)`
> This will scan (blocking) for scanDuration. After which it will return True or False, depending if the Crownstone with this address (like "f7:19:a4:ef:ea:f6") is in setup mode or not.

##### `shutDown()`
> Shut down the BLE module. This is should be done on closing your script

##### `setSettings(adminKey: string, memberKey: string, guestKey: string, referenceId="PythonLib", encryptionEnabled=True)`
> The Crownstone uses encryption by default. There are 3 keys used. You can find more information on that in the [protocol](https://github.com/crownstone/bluenet/blob/master/docs/PROTOCOL.md).
These keys are 16 characters long like "adminKeyForCrown" or 32 characters as a hex string like "9332b7abf19b86ff48156d88c687def6". The referenceId is optional. If you know what you're doing, you can disable the encryption but it should never be required.


##### `loadSettingsFromFile(path: string)`
> As an alternative to using setSettings, you can load it from a json file. The path is relative to the script being executed. An example of this json file is:
>```
>{
>  "admin":  "adminKeyForCrown",
>  "member": "memberKeyForHome",
>  "guest":  "guestKeyForOther"
>}
>```

##### `connect(address: string)`
> This will connect to the Crownstone with the provided MAC address. You get get this address by scanning or getting the nearest Crownstone. More on this below.

##### `setupCrownstone(address: string, crownstoneId: int, meshAccessAddress: string, ibeaconUUID: string, ibeaconMajor: uint16, ibeaconMinor: uint16)`
> New Crownstones are in setup mode. In this mode they are open to receiving encryption keys. This method facilitates this process. No manual connection is required.
> - address is the MAC address.
> - crownstoneId is a uint8 id for this Crownstone
> - meshAccessAddress is a uint32 with a number of requirements. All Crownstones with a shared meshAccessAddress can receive each others messages. Keep in mind that they need a shared keyset to understand the messages. To facilitate the creation of an access address, there is a util function available. More on this at the Util section.
> - ibeaconUUID is a string like "d8b094e7-569c-4bc6-8637-e11ce4221c18"
> - ibeaconMajor is a number between 0 and 65535
> - ibeaconMinor is a number between 0 and 65535

##### `disconnect()`
> This will disconnect from the connected Crownstone.

##### `getCrownstonesByScanning(scanDuration=3)`
> This will scan for scanDuration in seconds and return an array of the Crownstone it has found. This is an array of dictionaries that look like this:
>```
>{
>    "address": string,      # mac address like "f7:19:a4:ef:ea:f6"
>    "setupMode": boolean,   # is this Crownstone in setup mode?
>    "validated": boolean,   # does this Crownstone share our encryption key set?
>    "rssi": Float           # average of the rssi of this Crownstone. If None, there have been no valid measurements.
>}
>```
>This array can be directly put in the 'addressesToExclude' field of the 'getNearest..' methods.

##### `startScanning(scanDuration=3)`
> This will start scanning for Crownstones in a background thread. The scanDuration denotes how long we will scan for. Once scanning is active, Topic.advertisement events will be triggered with the advertisements of the Crownstones that share our encryption keys or are in setup mode.

##### `stopScanning()`
> This will stop an active scan.

##### `getNearestCrownstone(rssiAtLeast=-100, scanDuration=3, returnFirstAcceptable=False, addressesToExclude=[])`
> This will search for the nearest Crownstone. It will return ANY Crownstone, not just the ones sharing our encryption keys.
> - rssiAtLeast, you can use this to indicate a maximum distance
> - scanDuration, the amount of time we scan (in seconds)
> - returnFirstAcceptable, if this is True, we return on the first Crownstone in the rssiAtLeast range. If it is False, we will scan for the timeout duration and return the closest one.
> - addressesToExclude, this is an array of either address strings (like "f7:19:a4:ef:ea:f6") or an array of dictionaries that each contain an address field (like what you get from "getCrownstonesByScanning").

##### `getNearestValidatedCrownstone(rssiAtLeast=-100, scanDuration=3, returnFirstAcceptable=False, addressesToExclude=[])`
> Same as getNearestCrownstone but will only search for Crownstones with the same encryption keys.

##### `getNearestSetupCrownstone(rssiAtLeast=-100, scanDuration=3, returnFirstAcceptable=False, addressesToExclude=[])`
> Same as getNearestCrownstone but will only search for Crownstones in setup mode.


## Control Module

The modules contain groups of methods. You can access them like this:
```python
from BluenetLib.BLE import BluenetBle

# initialize the Bluetooth Core
bluenetBle = BluenetBle()

# set the switch stat eusing the control module
bluenetBle.connect(address)
bluenetBle.control.setSwitchState(0)
bluenetBle.disconnect()
```


Methods:

##### `setSwitchState(switchState: float)`
> You can switch the Crownstone. 0 for off, 1 for on, between 0 and 1 to dim. If you want to dim, make sure dimming is enabled. You can enable this using the allowDimming method.
##### `switchRelay(switchState)`
> DEVELOPMENT ONLY: you can switch the relay. 0 for off, 1 for on. Use the setSwitchState instead.
##### `switchPWM(switchState)`
> DEVELOPMENT ONLY: you can switch the IGBTs. 0 for off, 1 for on, in between for dimming. Use the setSwitchState instead.
##### `commandFactoryReset()`
> Assuming you have the encryption keys, you can use this method to put the Crownstone back into setup mode.
##### `allowDimming(allow: bool)`
> Enable or disable dimming on this Crownstone. Required if you want to dim with setSwitchState.
##### `disconnect()`
> Tell the Crownstone to disconnect from you. This can help if your Bluetooth stack does not reliably disconnect.
##### `lockSwitch(lock: bool)`
> Lock the switch. If locked, it's switchState cannot be changed.
##### `reset()`
> Restart the Crownstone.


## State Module

This is used to get state variables from the Crownstone. [https://github.com/crownstone/bluenet/blob/master/docs/PROTOCOL.md#state-packet-1]

The modules contain groups of methods. You can access them like this:
```python
from BluenetLib.BLE import BluenetBle

# initialize the Bluetooth Core
bluenetBle = BluenetBle()

# set the switch state using the control module
bluenetBle.connect(address)
switchstate = bluenetBle.state.getSwitchState()
bluenetBle.disconnect()
```


##### `getSwitchState()`
> Get the switch state in the raw form [https://github.com/crownstone/bluenet/blob/master/docs/PROTOCOL.md#switch_state_packet]
##### `getSwitchStateFloat()`
> Get the switchState in the range [0 .. 1]
##### `getTime()`
> Get the time on the Crownstone as a timestamp since epoch in seconds. This has been corrected for location.

## Util

Util contains a number (one right now) methods that will help you use the lib.

##### generateMeshAccessAddress()
> Generate the mesh access address used in the setup. It adheres to the requirements as per the Bluetooth spec:
> BLE specification's rules are defined in Core spec 4.2 Vol. 6 Part B Chapter 2.1.2 and are as follows:
> The initiator shall ensure that the Access Address meets the following requirements:
> - It shall not be the advertising channel packets’ Access Address.
> - It shall not have all four octets equal.
> - It shall not be a sequence that differs from the advertising channel packets’ Access Address by only one bit.
> - It shall have no more than six consecutive zeros or ones.
> - It shall have no more than 24 transitions.
> - It shall have a minimum of two transitions in the most significant six bits.

```python
from BluenetLib import Util

accessAddress = Util.generateMeshAccessAddress()
```

## EventBus

You can obtain the eventBus directly from the lib:

```
from BluenetLib import BluenetEventBus, Topics
```

##### `subscribe(TopicName: enum, functionPointer)`
> Returns a subscription ID that can be used to unsubscribe again with the unsubscribe method

##### `unsubscribe(subscriptionId: number)`
> This will stop the invocation of the function you provided in the subscribe method, unsubscribing you from the event.

These can be used like this:

```python

# simple example function to print the data you receive
def showNewData(data):
	print("received new data: ", data)


# Set up event listeners
BluenetEventBus.subscribe(Topics.newDataAvailable, showNewData)

# unsubscribe again
BluenetEventBus.unsubscribe(subscriptionId)
```

## Events

These events are available for the BLE part of this lib:

##### `Topics.newDataAvailable`
> This is a topic with a summary of the data of an advertisement. If you care about the power usage, you can get it from here.
 For the full advertisement, you can use the Topics.advertisement as shown below.
> Data format is a dictionary with the fields shown below:
>```python
> {
>     id:                           int    # crownstone id (0-255)
>     setupMode:                    bool   # is in setup mode

>     errorMode:                    bool   # summary type errorMode : the errors JSON is valid. This alternates with normal advertisements
>     errors: {
>         overCurrent:              bool

>     }
>     timeIsSet:                    bool   # this crownstone knows what time it is
